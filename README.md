# ROB535 Perception Project
The image classification project was undertaken as part of ROB 535: Self- Driving Cars - Controls and Perception. The aim was to classify a vehicle in the given image. Image classification task is done using state-of-the-art ResNet architecture with our own modifications.

<h1>Description</h1>
* main.ipynb - This file loads the dataset for training, the neural network model and performs the training task <br />
* Custom_Image_Dataset.ipynb - The file performs preprocessing on the images of the dataset <br />
* Custom_Read_Data.ipynb - The file reads the dataset, and outputs the images matched to its ground truth <br />
* test.ipynb - Post training, this file is used to test the model accuracy. It generates a .csv file of the classification results <br />
* resnet.ipynb - Contains the neural network model, Resnet-182 <br />
* train.ipynb - This file contains code for training and validation <br />

<h1>Execution Steps</h1>
- For training the model, run main.ipynb <br />
- For testing and obtaining the results, run test.ipynb <br />
